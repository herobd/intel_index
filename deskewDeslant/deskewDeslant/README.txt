This is a small project which takes a document image and 
* deskews it
* segments the lines of text
* deslants the lines of text
* appends the lines back together.

It uses a hardcoded threshold for binarization and in general is not gaurunteed to be robust.

Also, any of the files names d<something>.h/.cpp are Doug Kennard's image processing code. I did not write these.
